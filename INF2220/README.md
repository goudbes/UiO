# INF2220 - Algorithms and data structures (Autumn 2016)
## Course assignments written in Java.

Basic data structures such as stacks, trees, graphs, hash tables and priority queues, together with algorithms for traversing and manipulating these structures. Different implementations are covered, with emphasis being put on efficiency, program structure and abstract data types. Different sorting algorithms will be examined. Important elements in the course include recursive programming as well as evaluation and description of program efficiency.
