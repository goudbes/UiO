Communication with server:

I have decided to use 4 bytes for get_job message to the server like this:

* 1st byte: char 'G' which is an indicator that the client asking for
  jobs.

* 2nd-4th byte: Used to store number of jobs. 0 in case we want
  all. Max is then 2^24=16777215 jobs.

When client wants to send a message to the server that it terminates
normally (without error) it sends 1 byte the char 'T'.

When the client sends a message to the server that it terminates due
to error I send 1 byte with the char 'E'.
